'''
You are organizing an event where attendees have unique registration numbers. These numbers are provided in the list attendees. 
You need to arrange the attendees in a way that, when their registration numbers are revealed one by one, the numbers appear in 
increasing order.

The process of revealing the attendee list follows these steps repeatedly until all registration numbers are revealed:

Take the top registration number from the list, reveal it, and remove it from the list.
If there are still registration numbers in the list, take the next top registration number and move it to the bottom of the list.
If there are still unrevealed registration numbers, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
Return an ordering of the registration numbers that would reveal the attendees in increasing order.


Example Output:

[2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
[1,1000]

You are organizing a large event and need to arrange the attendees based on their priority levels. You are given a 0-indexed list 
attendees, where each element represents the priority level of an attendee, and an integer priority that indicates a particular level 
of priority.

Your task is to rearrange the attendees list such that the following conditions are met:

Every attendee with a priority less than the specified priority appears before every attendee with a priority greater than the specified
priority.
Every attendee with a priority equal to the specified priority appears between the attendees with lower and higher priorities.
The relative order of the attendees within each priority group (less than, equal to, greater than) must be preserved.
Return the attendees list after the rearrangement.

'''You are organizing an event, and you have a 0-indexed list guests of even length, where each element represents either an attendee
(positive integers) or an absence (negative integers). The list contains an equal number of attendees and absences.

You should return the guests list rearranged to satisfy the following conditions:

Every consecutive pair of elements must have opposite signs, indicating that each attendee is followed by an absence or vice versa.
For all elements with the same sign, the order in which they appear in the original list must be preserved.
The rearranged list must begin with an attendee (positive integer).
Return the rearranged list after organizing the guests according to the conditions.

Initialize Two Pointers:

i = 0 → Points to the next position where a positive number should be.
j = 1 → Points to the next position where a negative number should be.
Iterate Through the List:

If guests[i] > 0 (correct position), move i forward by 2.
If guests[j] < 0 (correct position), move j forward by 2.
If guests[i] < 0 and guests[j] > 0, swap guests[i] and guests[j] and move both pointers forward by 2.
Repeat Until the List is Fully Rearranged.

'''
You are organizing a series of events, and each event is represented by a parenthesis in the string schedule, where an opening parenthesis
( represents the start of an event, and a closing parenthesis ) represents the end of an event. A balanced schedule means every event that 
starts has a corresponding end.

However, due to some scheduling issues, the current schedule might not be balanced. In one move, you can insert either a start or an end 
at any position in the schedule.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make the schedule balanced.
