Problem 2: Add Furniture
Players and villagers in Animal Crossing can add furniture to their inventory to decorate their 
house.

Update the Villager class with a new method add_item() that takes in one parameter, item_name.

The method should validate the item_name.

If the item is valid, add item_name to the villagerâ€™s furniture attribute.
The method does not need to return any values.
item_name is valid if it has one of the following values: "acoustic guitar", "ironwood kitchenette", 
"rattan armchair", "kotatsu", or "cacao tree".

class Villager:
    # ... methods from previous problems
	
    def add_item(self, item_name):
        pass
'''

# class Villager:
#     def __init__(self, name, species, catchphrase):
#         self.name = name
#         self.species = species
#         self.catchphrase = catchphrase
#         self.furniture = []
#     def add_item(self, item_name):
#         if item_name in ["acoustic guitar", "ironwood kitchenette", "rattan armchair", "kotatsu","cacao tree"]:
#             self.furniture.append(item_name)
# alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "guvnor")
# print(alice.furniture)

# alice.add_item("acoustic guitar")
# print(alice.furniture)

# alice.add_item("cacao tree")
# print(alice.furniture)

# alice.add_item("nintendo switch")
# print(alice.furniture)

Problem 3: Group by Personality
The Villager class has been updated below to include the new string attribute personality 
representing the character's personality type.

Outside of the Villager class, write a function of_personality_type(). Given a list of Villager 
instances townies and a string personality_type as parameters, 
return a list containing the names of all villagers in townies with personality 
personality_type. Return the names in any order.

# print(of_personality_type([isabelle, bob, stitches], "Cranky"))

Problem 4: Telephone
The Villager constructor has been updated to include an additional attribute neighbor. 
A villager's neighbor is another Villager instance and represents their closest neighbor. 
By default, a Villager's neighbor is set to None.

Given two Villager instances start_villager and target_villager, 
write a function message_received() that returns True if you can pass a message from 
the start_villager to the target_villager through a series of neighbors and False otherwise.
